# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is my first JavaScript project in Odin. I will be creating recreating "paper, rock, scissors" and it will be played in the console. The
other player will be the computer. We will practice using "prompt" and "loop", as well as everything we have learned about functions thus far.
We will be linking an external JS file.
