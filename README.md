# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is my first JavaScript project in Odin. I will be creating recreating "paper, rock, scissors" and it will be played in the console. The
other player will be the computer. We will practice using "prompt" and "loop", as well as everything we have learned about functions thus far.
We will be linking an external JS file.

Description: 
We’re going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. If you don’t know what that is check the Wikipedia article or this ridiculous step-by-step. For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text, so don’t forget to keep the code on GitHub!
